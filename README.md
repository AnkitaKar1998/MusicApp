# Music App

This is a dummy project in Android which I had made for one of my semester lab sessions, Mobile Communication and Computing (MCC).
<ul>
<li> In this project I have implemented SQLite database in Android. 
<li> Data of a user can be inserted in SQLite database which is created internally in the mobile device. Data of all inserted users can be viewed in the app.
<li> Also there is an additional feature in this app which allows the user to see the contents of the internal SQLite database.
<li> For more details of the app, refer <b><i>Android_SQLite_Guidelines.pdf</i></b> file. This file also contains some useful YouTube links.
<li> For demo of this project refer <b><i>Music_App_Demo.mp4</i></b> file.
<li> The APK of this project is also available in this repository. Refer <b><i>Music_App.apk</i></b> file.
</ul>
